# Kopano Konnect SETTINGS

# OpenID Connect Issuer Identifier.
# This setting defines the OpenID Connect Issuer Identifier to be provided by
# this Konnect server. Setting this is mandatory and the setting must be a
# https URL which can be accessed by all applications and users which are to
# use this Konnect for sign-in or validation. Defaults to "https://localhost" to
# allow unconfigured startup.
#oidc_issuer_identifier=https://localhost

# Address:port specifier for where konnectd should listen for
# incoming connections. Defaults to `127.0.0.1:8777`.
#listen = 127.0.0.1:8777

# Disable TLS validation for all client request.
# When set to yes, TLS certificate validation is turned off. This is insecure
# and should not be used in production setups. Defaults to `no`.
#insecure = no

# Identity manager which provides the user backend Konnect should use. This is
# one of `kc` or `ldap`. Defaults to `kc`, which means Konnect will use a
# Kopano Groupware Storage server as backend.

# Full file path to a PEM encoded PKCS#1 or PKCS#5 private key which is used to
# sign tokens. This file must exist and be valid to be able to start the
# service. A suitable key can be generated with:
#   `openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA \
#     -out konnectd-signing-private-key.pem.pem \
#     -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096`
# If this is not set, Konnect will try to load

# default. If set, the file must be there.

# Key ID to use in created JWT. This setting is useful once private keys need
# to be changed because they expire. It should be a unique value identiying
# the signing_private_key. Example: `k20180912-1`. Not set by default, which
# means that Konnect uses the file name of the key file (dereferencing symlinks)
# without extension.

# JWT signing method. This must match the private key type as defined in
# signing_private_key and defaults to `PS256`.

# loads all `*.pem` files in that directory and adds the public key parts (if
# found) to the validator for received tokens using the file name without
# extension as key ID.
